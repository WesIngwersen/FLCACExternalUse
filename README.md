# Draft: Terms of Use for Federal LCA Commons Datasets
This is a working document to describe the Terms of Use for Federal LCA Commons datasets.  www.lcacommons.gov  

## Intended Audience
The immediate audience for this document is so called "third party" distributors of LCA "data".  These are organizations that produce and distribute (often for a fee) data products in support of (typcically) commercial LCA modeling.  The consumers of these products are independent LCA consultants, or LCA practioners embedded in a company, looking for a conceptually consistent, trust worthy, easy-to-use data product to support an LCA program or business.  Third party distributors will identify best available datasets from a range of sources including government produced data, and modify them for inclusion in their data package.  Attribution to the source of data contributes to consumer confidence.  But the modifications may alter the representation of the data in significant ways.

Other potential audience could include:
- academics looking for resources to support research
- regulatory agencies at state or local level looking for best available LCI
- independent consultants
- students
- ???

(note: is there a class of user this isn't pertinant to?  Is this just a general Terms of Use?)

## Use Cases

## Outline / Areas of Concern

- Attribution of datasets to origniating agency
  - proper agency/actor citation
  - limitations to data modification.  What changes are permissable while still being attributable to orignal agency?
- Required documentation of changes
- Known unacceptable uses, description of cases.
